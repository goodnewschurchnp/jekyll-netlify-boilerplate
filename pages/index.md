To build a church website, we use static approach,'static' means opposite to "dynamic' website which has a database, the static website doesn't has a database, which make it less complicated and light-weight,there are similar services like [vercel](https://vercel.com/), [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [github pages](https://pages.github.com) and so on.

The guideline like this: select a template, edit in github.com and host in netlify.com 

As far as I understand,there are two use cases for website:

1). information

the church service for local people,the photoes goes to Facebook group and leave a link on website,the website contents mainly for outside stranger,like fund rising.All website are in this stage, there are home page and contact page along with outside Facebook group link.

2). evangelist

no matter with or without website can stop you preach, evanglist means event centric and the church move to spreading both offline and online.

What kind of template should we choose, in my mind there are some guidlines:

1). responsive, automaticly layout change between mobile and desktop, good for mobile phone user.

2). vertical layout, like an app, good for mobile phone user.

3). a hero image,that is a big image in home page to show theme of the site.

4). deployed in netlify.com, normally a church website need less update frequency, need simple interface, netlify.com suppose to be free to use upto some limitation, Jekyll(a popular Static Site Generator name) was in market in 2008, netlify.com appeared in 2014, so the website deployable in netlify.com means the template can be used free of charge,especially Jekyll template.
